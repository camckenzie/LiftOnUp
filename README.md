# LiftOnUp

Lift On Up is a fitness application that will motivate people to exercise,  stay in shape, and be healthy.  Sometimes motivation can be a key factor that prevents people for exercising. Other times, people who may want to exercise may not know the proper routine or the proper forms to follow. By allowing users to create routines, track their schedule, and providing them with a multitude of exercises with instructions, we are giving them the ability to be more successful in achieving their fitness goals. This application is compatible with iOS devices.
